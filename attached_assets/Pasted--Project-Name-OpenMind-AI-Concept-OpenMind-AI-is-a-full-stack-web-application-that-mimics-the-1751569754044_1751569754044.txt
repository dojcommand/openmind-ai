🌐 Project Name: OpenMind AI
🧠 Concept

OpenMind AI is a full-stack web application that mimics the functionality of ChatGPT, providing users with an AI chatbot for:

    Research Assistance: Academic, technical, or general topic exploration.

    Coding Help: Debugging, writing, explaining, or optimizing code in multiple languages.

    Document Analysis: Let users upload text or code for AI analysis.

    Personalized Workspace: Save chat sessions, bookmarks, and prompts.

It uses the OpenAI GPT-4 API under the hood to power the AI chatbot.
🧩 Core Features
1. 🔐 User Authentication

    Sign up, login, logout

    JWT-based session authentication

    Password hashing with bcrypt

    Role-based access (admin/user)

    OAuth 2.0 support (Google login, optional)

2. 💬 AI Chat Interface

    Real-time chat interface like ChatGPT

    Uses OpenAI API key (user or system-wide)

    Markdown support with syntax highlighting

    Threaded chat history with session saving

3. 🧾 Chat History + Workspace

    Save chat sessions

    Rename, delete, or search past sessions

    Tag chats by topic (e.g. coding, science, health)

    “Favorite” responses for quick reference

4. 🧪 Research Tools

    Quick search assistant (like a mini search engine)

    Summarize long articles or papers (URL or text input)

    Document upload (PDF, DOCX, TXT) → AI parses content

    Inline citation support for academic help

5. 🧑‍💻 Coding Assistant Tools

    Code generation, explanation, and debugging

    Multi-language syntax support (Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.)

    IDE-style code view

    Optional playground to test small Python snippets via a backend sandbox (restricted)

🏗️ Tech Stack
🔧 Frontend

    React + TypeScript

    Next.js (for SSR/SEO benefits)

    Tailwind CSS for styling

    React Query or SWR for data fetching

    Zustand or Redux for state management

🖥️ Backend

    Node.js + Express

    REST API (or GraphQL if preferred)

    OpenAI API integration

    JWT authentication

    MongoDB (with Mongoose) or PostgreSQL

    Rate-limiting and abuse prevention

🗃️ Database

    MongoDB or PostgreSQL

        Users

        Chat sessions

        Roles & settings

☁️ Deployment

    Vercel (frontend)

    Render / Railway / Fly.io / Heroku (backend)

    MongoDB Atlas (cloud DB)

    S3-compatible storage for file uploads (optional)

🔐 Monetization / Admin Features (Optional)

    Admin panel to manage users, chat limits, and logs

    Stripe integration for premium usage limits or plans

    Track API usage (OpenAI cost control)

🚀 Bonus Features (Stretch Goals)

    PDF highlighting + AI notes generation

    Chrome extension for research summarization

    Mobile-friendly PWA or native wrapper with Capacitor

    GPT function-calling for plugin-like behavior (e.g., fetch URL, code execution, etc.)

    Voice chat using Web Speech API

🧠 How It Works (Simplified Flow)

    User signs up and logs in

    Enters a chat session with a prompt (e.g., "Explain multithreading in C++")

    Backend sends the prompt to the OpenAI API using a stored API key

    OpenAI returns response → shown in chat

    Chat is stored in database linked to the user for future reference

🔑 API Key Use

    Site-wide key stored securely (server-side), or

    Optionally allow users to input their own OpenAI API keys

    Implement rate limits per user to control costs
